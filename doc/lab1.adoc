== Infrastructure Migration Solution - Lab 1 Guide

:numbered:

== Overview


In this lab, you will learn how to use the Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) available in Red Hat CloudForms, to migrate virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) or Red Hat Openstack.
We will also demonstrate how to use Ansible playbooks to perform additional tasks (pre or post migration).

The password to access all services is available link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1174612-accessing-red-hat-solutions-lab-in-rhpds[here]

This lab environment has been pre-configured to allow you to execute quickly your migrations.   Here are the configuration steps already done:

* Configuration of all providers in CloudForms (VMware, RHV and Openstack)
* Configuration of the conversion hosts for each target providers (RHV and OSP)
* Configuration of Ansible playbooks required for this lab



=== Goal
* Migrate several VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution
* Convert the operating system of some OEL and CentOS VMs to RHEL using a post-migration Ansible playbook
+
NOTE: The source VMs are not deleted, only powered off once the migration is done. This measure can also be used as "rollback" in case a migration failure occurs.

* It takes about 20 ~ 25 minutes for the demo to load completely and become accessible.
** Wait for the full demo to load, even if some of its systems are marked "Up."
* Watch for an email with information about how to access your demo environment.
** Make note of the email's contents: a list of hostnames, IP addresses, and your GUID.
** Whenever you see <YOUR-GUID> in the demo instructions, replace it with the GUID provided in the email.
* You can get real-time updates and status of your demo environment at https://www.opentlc.com/rhpds-status.
====

[TIP]
Be mindful of the runtime of your demo environment! It may take several hours to complete the demo, so you may need to extend the runtime. This is especially important in later steps when you are building virtual machines. For information on how to extend runtime and lifetime, see https://www.opentlc.com/lifecycle.

== Environment

A full new migration environment is deployed on every request. To make the environment unique a 4 character identifier is assigned to it (i.e. `1e37`), this identifier is referred in this documentation as *YOUR-GUID*.

The migration environment consists of the following systems:

* *CloudForms:* `https://cf-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::cloudforms_login.png[CloudForms Login]
+
[TIP]
You can also find these URLs in the email provided when you provisioned the demo environment.
+
image::cloudforms_dashboard.png[CloudForms Dashboard]


=== Fix the provider authentication in CloudForms

This step is required to address an issue with our lab environment.   Please note that you typically don't have to do this in a normal production environment.

. Log in with user `admin` and the provided password in CloudForms. Once in the web interface, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_1.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 1]

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in a provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_2.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_3.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 3]
+
[TIP]
Take into account that vCenter may take longer to start.

. To have proper information on all the resources available, check the provider's box, go to *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_4.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 4]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_5.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 5]

. Time to go to *Compute -> Clouds -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_1.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 1]


. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in the provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_2.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_3.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 3]

. To have proper information on all the resources available, check the provider's box, go to *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*.
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_4.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 4]
+
image::cloudforms_cloud_providers_5.png[CloudForms Clouds Providers 5]

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. All VMs, Orphaned VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_2.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 2]
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *vSphere* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_3.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 3]
+
[IMPORTANT]
*BE CAREFUL - Make sure that all VMs running on vSphere are up and running (GREEN ICON).  If some of them are powered OFF (RED ICON) , select all of them and power them ON using the power button: Power / Power ON*

. Power OFF VMs icon
+
image::poweroff.png[poweroff, 50]

. Power ON VMs icon  -> Make sure all VMs on vSphere are ON
+
image::poweron.png[poweron, 50]

[NOTE]
Our VMs must be ON for the migration as we will use a pre-migration Ansible playbook.   This pre-migration playbook will fail if your VMs are not powered on.   Powered OFF VMs can be migrate when no pre-migration playbooks are required.

. Finally, have a look at the current operating systems running on VMware.  The following icons are used to identify RHEL, Oracle Linux and CentOS.   Currently, your *oracledb* VM should be running *Oracle Linux 7*.   And your *tomcat* VM should be running *CentOS*
+
image::operating_systems.png[Operating systems]

[NOTE]
Later in this lab, we will use a post migration playbook running the Convert2RHEL tool to convert our VMs to RHEL.   This playbook also makes it possible to run the leap tool to automatically upgrade your VM to RHEL8.  That said, we will skip this step for this lab in order to save time as migrating to RHEL8 would require the installation of multiple packages.

== Create an Infrastructure Mapping (vSphere to RHV)

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration -> Infrastructure Mappings*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_1.png[Infrastructure Mapping 1]

. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type your first mapping name, example `VMware to RHV`, select as *Target Provider* `Red Hat Virtualization`  and click *next*.
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the mapping.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_3b.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Map Compute*, select your VMware cluster and your RHV cluster, click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Map Storage*, select the NFS storage on both sides, click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_5b.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Map Networks*, 3 different networks must be mapped.  You will have to map your service network, your service-dmz network and your management network.  Then click *Add Mapping*.   The screenshot below shows all the mapping as they should be on your screen once completed.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6c.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, you get a confirmation that your new infrastructure mapping has been completed. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]

In these steps an *Infrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat Virtualization.   This mapping information will be used later when migrating VMs to appropriately migrate your VMs to the right clusters, storages and networks without having to ask this information for every VM migration.

== Migrating VMs to RHV with a Migration Plan

=== Create the migration plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration -> Migration Plans*.
+
image::migration_plan_0.png[Migration Plan 0]

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select in the drop down menu the *Infrastructure Mapping* your just created.   Then enter a name for your migration plan and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_2b.png[Migration Plan 2]
+
[NOTE]
Keeping the default option will take us to the VM menu selector. For massive conversions a CSV file upload can be the right choice.

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *oracledb* and *tomcat*  virtual machines, as the ones to be migrated.
+
image::migration_plan_3.png[Migration Plan 3]
+
[NOTE]
VM selector has a filter to help find a set of VMs within a long list. We may try filtering by the term.

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Advanced Options*, we can assign *Pre* and *Post* migration playbooks to be executed before or after the migration.  For this use-case, as our VMs are using static IP, we will need to use the *ForceNIC* playbook as a pre-migration step to keep our network configuration on RHV.   We will also use a post-migration playbook named *Convert2RHEL* to automatically convert our OEL and CentOS VMs to RHEL after the migration is completed.   Make sure to have selected all the options as showed in the screenshot below, then click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_4c.png[Migration Plan 4]
+
[NOTE]
Our original VM on vSphere will only be powered off.  If anything goes wrong while converting my VM to RHEL, I can simply rollback by powering ON my original VM on VMWare.

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Schedule*, select *Save migration plan to run later*. Click *Create*
+
image::migration_plan_5.png[Migration Plan 5]
+
[NOTE]
The migration plan can be run immediately, by choosing the other option.

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, your migration plan has now been saved. Click *Close*.
+
image::migration_plan_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. Back to the migration page we will see how the *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* are ready to be run
+
image::migration_plan_7.png[Migration Plan 7]

=== Launch Migration

. To launch the migration, while in the *Compute -> Migration* page, click on the *Migrate* button in the *ticket-monster-plan-app*.
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. The migration will get initiated.  Now we'll have to wait for the migration to be completed.  You can either grab a coffee, take a break or go to the troubleshooting section *here* to learn more while this is running.
+
image::migration_running_2b.png[Migration Running 2]
+

. Success, your migration has been completed.
+
image::migration_running_3b.png[Migration Running 2]
[NOTE]
Additionally the migration logs can be downloaded and accessed post VM migration. This is useful for troubleshooting errors or just to check the migration details. It's worth mentioning that if the migration fails prior to the VM being migrated this log will not be available. To access the log navigate to Completed Plans, and click **Download Log** and then **Migration log** next to the desired VM.


. Finally, let's confirm that our VMs are now running RHEL on RHV.  Go back to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.  And filter only the RHV VMs by clicking on the provider (as previously done for VMWare).
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. Your *oracledb* and *tomcat* VMs should have the following icon.  Congratulations! you are now running your workload on a fully supported Red Hat stack.
+
image::RHELonRHVicon.png[RHEL on RHV]
[NOTE]
Note that those VMs still also exist on the VMware side but they are just powered off.   You can now delete them if you'd like or keep them as a backup.   As you can see, you can also easily rollback in case of any issue by restarting those VMs on VMWare.


== Create an Infrastructure Mapping (vSphere to OpenStack)

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration -> Infrastructure Mappings*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_1.png[Infrastructure Mapping 1]

. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type the name `ticket-monster-map-osp`, select as *Target Provider* `Red Hat OpenStack Platform`, and click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_3.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the mapping.

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Clusters*, select *Source Cluster* as `vSphere\DC01\Cluster01` and *Target Provider\Project* as `OpenStack\ticket-monster` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Datastores*, and having selected *Cluster01 (ticket-monster)* as the cluster to work with, select *Source Datastore* as `vSphere\Datastore` and *Target Datastore* as `OpenStack\default_store` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Networks*, and having selected *Cluster01 (ticket-monster)* as the cluster to work with. We will start by mapping the network used by VMs to connect yto each other (i.e. JBoss EAP to the Database). We select *Source Network* as `vSphere\App-Internal-DPortGroup` and *Target Network* as `OpenStack\service` and click *Add Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_6a.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]
+
* We will continue by mapping the network used by VMs to expose services to the internet(i.e. the Load Balancer exposing the Ticket Monster app). We select *Source Network* as `vSphere\App-DMZ-DPortGroup` and *Target Network* as `OpenStack\DMZ` and click *Add Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_6b.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]
+
* Finally we can map the management network. To do so, select *Source Network* as `vSphere\Management Network` and *Target Network* as `OpenStack\Admin` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *create*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, a message `All mappings in ticket-monster-map-osp have been mapped.` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_osp_8.png[Infrastructure Mapping 8]

In these steps an *Infrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

== Migrating VMs to OSP with a Migration Plan

=== Create and run the migration plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration -> Migration Plans*.
+
image::migration_plan_0.png[Migration Plan 0]

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_osp_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select in the drop down menu the *Infrastructure Mapping* to be used, `ticket-monster-osp`, add the name `ticket-monster-plan-lb` and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_osp_2.png[Migration Plan 2]

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *lb* virtual machine, as the one to be migrated.
+
image::migration_plan_osp_3.png[Migration Plan 3]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Instance Properties*, we can assign a specific OpenStack Flavor to the instance. We keep `m1.medium` for it and Click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_osp_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Advanced Options*, we can assign *Pre* and *Post* migration playbooks to be executed during the migration. In the *pre-migration playbook service* we will select `rhel-premigrate-playbook`, then select to use the *Pre-migration Service* for `lb` and click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_osp_5.png[Migration Plan 5]
+
[NOTE]
The `lb` has an specific network configuration in which the name of the interfaces in origin is diferent than in the destination. We will use this playbook to convert the configuration.

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Schedule*, select *Start migration inmediately*. Click *Create*
+
image::migration_plan_osp_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. In the *step 6* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan-app is in progress` shall appear. Click *Close*.
+
image::migration_plan_osp_7.png[Migration Plan 7]

. Back to the migration page we will see how the *Migration Plan* is already running
+
image::migration_plan_osp_8.png[Migration Plan 8]

. Once the migration is finished ...
+
image::migration_running_osp_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. We can find the instance in *OpenStack* in the *ticket-monster* project:
+
image::migration_running_osp_2.png[Migration Running 2]

== Running migrations using a CSV file

. Migrate the remaining application servers and database VMs from VMware to RHV using a CSV file.

.. Download the CSV sample file from link:../conf/ticket_monster_migration_sample.csv[here] and save it as `ticket_monster_migration_db.csv`. Check that the content is the following:
+
image:ticket_monster_csv_file.png[Multiple VM CSV File]
+
[TIP]
CSV file format is specified in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_infrastructure_migration_solution/1.1/html/infrastructure_migration_solution_guide/migrating_the_infrastructure#Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[Official Documentation]

.. This sample file could be an example of a CMDB dump after processing. We may remove the lines we know we are not going to use, leaving only the header row and the `db` row. link:../conf/ticket_monster_migration_db.csv[Sample here].
+
image:ticket_monster_csv_db_file.png[Multiple VM CSV File]

.. Navigate to *Compute -> Migration -> Migration Plans* and click on *Create Migration Plan*. We will select the same infrastructure mapping previously created, `ticket-monster-mapping-rhv`, and select *Import CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated*. Click *Next*.
+
image::csv_migration_plan_1.png[CSV Migration Plan 1]
+
image::csv_migration_plan_2.png[CSV Migration Plan 2]
